# OpenGL Shaders
This work was completed during the first half of my final year, we were tasked with writing shaders for various shader techniques, such as normal mapping, bump mapping and parallax mapping, we also had to write shaders for multiple lighting techniques such as Phong and Blin-Phong. I built my render from the ground up using GLFW and glew.
